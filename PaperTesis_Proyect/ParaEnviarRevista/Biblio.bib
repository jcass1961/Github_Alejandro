  abstract  = {This paper's aim is to evaluate the effectivess of bootstrap methods
	in improving estimation of clutter properties in speckled imagery.
	Estimation is performed by standard maximum likelihood methods. We
	show that estimators obtained this way can be quite biased in finite
	samples, and develop bias correction schemes using bootstrap resampling.
	In particular, we propose a bootstrapping scheme which is an adaptation
	of that proposed by Efron (1990). The proposed bootstrap does not
	require the quantity of interest to have closed-form, as does Efron's
	original proposal. The adaptation we suggest is particularly important
	since the maximum likelihood estimator of interest does not have
	a closed-form. We show that this particular bootstrapping scheme
	outperforms alternative forms of bias reduction mechanisms, thus
	delivering more accurate inference. We also consider interval estimation
	using bootstrap methods, and show that a particular parametric bootstrap-based
	confidence interval is typically more reliable than both the asymptotic
	confidence interval and other bootstrap-based confidence intervals.
	An application to real data is presented and discussed.},

  abstract = {Due to the rapid advance of general-purpose graphics processing unit (GPU), it is an active research topic to study performance improvement of non-linear optimization with parallel implementation on GPU, as attested by the much research on parallel implementation of relatively simple optimization methods, such as the conjugate gradient method. We study in this context the L-BFGS-B method, or the limited memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno with boundaries, which is a sophisticated yet efficient optimization method widely used in computer graphics as well as general scientific computation. By analyzing and resolving the inherent dependencies of some of its search steps, we propose an efficient GPU-based parallel implementation of L-BFGS-B on the GPU. We justify our design decisions and demonstrate significant speed-up by our parallel implementation in solving the centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) problem as well as some typical computing problems.},

We analyze the performance of complex Wishart distribution, which is a widely used model for multi-look PolSAR images, and the robustness of five stochastic distances (Bhattacharyya, Kullback-Leibler, R&eacute;nyi, Hellinger and Chi-square) between Wishart distributions. Two unsupervised classification strategies were chosen: the Stochastic Clustering (SC) algorithm, which is based on the K-means algorithm but uses stochastic distance as the similarity metric, and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for Wishart Mixture Model. With the aim of assessing the performance of all algorithms presented here, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation over a set of simulated PolSAR images. A second experiment was conducted using the study area of Tapaj&oacute;s National Forest and the surrounding area, in Brazilian Amazon Forest. The PolSAR images were obtained by the satellite PALSAR. The results, in both experiments, suggest that the EM algorithm and the SC with Hellinger and the SC with Bhattacharyya distance provide a better classification performance. We also analyze the initialization problem for SC and EM algorithms, and we demonstrate how the initial centroid choice influences the final classification result.},

  abstract = {The statistical properties of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image texture reveal useful target characteristics. It is well-known that these images are affected by speckle and prone to extreme values due to double bounce and corner reflector. The G0I distribution is flexible enough to model different degrees of texture in speckled data. It is indexed by three parameters: alpha, related to the texture, gamma, a scale parameter, and L, the number of looks. Quality estimation of alpha is essential due to its immediate interpretability. In this letter, we exploit the connection between the G0I and Pareto distributions. With this, we obtain six estimators that have not been previously used in the SAR literature. We compare their behavior with others in the noisiest case for monopolarized intensity data, namely single look case. We evaluate them using Monte Carlo methods for noncontaminated and contaminated data, considering convergence rate, bias, mean squared error, and computational time. We conclude that two of these estimators based on the Pareto law are the safest choices when dealing with actual data and small samples, as is the case of despeckling techniques and segmentation, to name just two applications. We verify the results with an actual SAR image.},

  abstract = {Images obtained with coherent illumination, as is the case of sonar, ultrasound-B, laser and Synthetic Aperture Radar -- SAR, are affected by speckle noise which reduces the ability to extract information from the data. Specialized techniques are required to deal with such imagery, which has been modeled by the G0 distribution and under which regions with different degrees of roughness and mean brightness can be characterized by two parameters; a third parameter, the number of looks, is related to the overall signal-to-noise ratio. Assessing distances between samples is an important step in image analysis; they provide grounds of the separability and, therefore, of the performance of classification procedures. This work derives and compares eight stochastic distances and assesses the performance of hypothesis tests that employ them and maximum likelihood estimation. We conclude that tests based on the triangular distance have the closest empirical size to the theoretical one, while those based on the arithmetic-geometric distances have the best power. Since the power of tests based on the triangular distance is close to optimum, we conclude that the safest choice is using this distance for hypothesis testing, even when compared with classical distances as Kullback-Leibler and Bhattacharyya.},

  abstract  = {Many applications consecrate the use of asymmetric distributions,

	This paper presents the derivation of M-estimators with asymmetric
	influence functions, motivated by the GA0 distribution. This law,
	regarded as the universal model for speckled imagery, can be highly
	skewed and maximum likelihood estimation can be severely hampered
	by small percentages of outliers. These outliers appear mainly because
	the hypothesis of independence and equal distribution of observations
	are seldom satisfied in practice; for instance, in the process of
	filtering, some pixels within a window frequently come from regions
	with different underlying distributions. Traditional robust estimation
	methods, on the basis of symmetric robustifying functions, assume
	that the distribution is symmetric, but when the data distribution
	is asymmetric, these methods yield biased estimators. Empirical influence
	functions for maximum likelihood estimators are computed, and based
	on this information we propose the asymmetric M-estimator (AM-estimator),
	an M-estimator with asymmetric redescending functions. The performance
	of AM estimators is assessed, and it is shown that they either compete
	with or outperform both maximum likelihood and Huber-type M-estimators.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with numerical problems arising when performing maximum
	likelihood parameter estimation in speckled imagery using small samples.
	The noise that appears in images obtained with coherent illumination,
	as is the case of sonar, laser, ultrasound-B, and synthetic aperture
	radar, is called speckle, and it can neither be assumed Gaussian
	nor additive. The properties of speckle noise are well described
	by the multiplicative model, a statistical framework from which stem
	several important distributions. Amongst these distributions, one
	is regarded as the universal model for speckled data, namely, the
	G0 law. This paper deals with amplitude data, so the GA0 distribution
	will be used. The literature reports that techniques for obtaining
	estimates (maximum likelihood, based on moments and on order statistics)
	of the parameters of the GA0 distribution require samples of hundreds,
	even thousands, of observations in order to obtain sensible values.
	This is verified for maximum likelihood estimation, and a proposal
	based on alternate optimization is made to alleviate this situation.
	The proposal is assessed with real and simulated data, showing that
	the convergence problems are no longer present. A Monte Carlo experiment
	is devised to estimate the quality of maximum likelihood estimators
	in small samples, and real data is successfully analyzed with the
	proposed alternated procedure. Stylized empirical influence functions
	are computed and used to choose a strategy for computing maximum
	likelihood estimates that is resistant to outliers.},

We apply BS and LN kernel density estimators to high frequency intraday time duration data. The comparisons are made on several nonparametric kernel density estimators.
