		This paper presents the derivation of M-estimators with asymmetric

		skewed and maximum likelihood estimation can be severely hampered
		by small percentages of outliers. These outliers appear mainly because
		the hypothesis of independence and equal distribution of observations
		are seldom satisfied in practice; for instance, in the process of
		filtering, some pixels within a window frequently come from regions
		with different underlying distributions. Traditional robust estimation
		methods, on the basis of symmetric robustifying functions, assume
		that the distribution is symmetric, but when the data distribution
		is asymmetric, these methods yield biased estimators. Empirical influence
		functions for maximum likelihood estimators are computed, and based
		on this information we propose the asymmetric M-estimator (AM-estimator),
		an M-estimator with asymmetric redescending functions. The performance
		of AM estimators is assessed, and it is shown that they either compete
		with or outperform both maximum likelihood and Huber-type M-estimators.},

	ABSTRACT = {This paper address unsupervised classification strategies applied to Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) images. We analyze the performance of complex Wishart distribution, which is a widely used model for multi-look PolSAR images, and the robustness of five stochastic distances (Bhattacharyya, Kullback-Leibler, R&eacute;nyi, Hellinger and Chi-square) between Wishart distributions. Two unsupervised classification strategies were chosen: the Stochastic Clustering (SC) algorithm, which is based on the K-means algorithm but uses stochastic distance as the similarity metric, and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for Wishart Mixture Model. With the aim of assessing the performance of all algorithms presented here, we performed a Monte Carlo simulation over a set of simulated PolSAR images. A second experiment was conducted using the study area of Tapaj&oacute;s National Forest and the surrounding area, in Brazilian Amazon Forest. The PolSAR images were obtained by the satellite PALSAR. The results, in both experiments, suggest that the EM algorithm and the SC with Hellinger and the SC with Bhattacharyya distance provide a better classification performance. We also analyze the initialization problem for SC and EM algorithms, and we demonstrate how the initial centroid choice influences the final classification result.},

Specialized techniques are required to deal with such imagery, which has been modeled by the G0 distribution and under which regions with different degrees of roughness and mean brightness can be characterized by two parameters; a third parameter, the number of looks, is related to the overall signal-to-noise ratio. Assessing distances between samples is an important step in image analysis; they provide grounds of the separability and, therefore, of the performance of classification procedures. This work derives and compares eight stochastic distances and assesses the performance of hypothesis tests that employ them and maximum likelihood estimation. We conclude that tests based on the triangular distance have the closest empirical size to the theoretical one, while those based on the arithmetic-geometric distances have the best power. Since the power of tests based on the triangular distance is close to optimum, we conclude that the safest choice is using this distance for hypothesis testing, even when compared with classical distances as Kullback-Leibler and Bhattacharyya.},

We study in this context the L-BFGS-B method, or the limited memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno with boundaries, which is a sophisticated yet efficient optimization method widely used in computer graphics as well as general scientific computation. By analyzing and resolving the inherent dependencies of some of its search steps, we propose an efficient GPU-based parallel implementation of L-BFGS-B on the GPU. We justify our design decisions and demonstrate significant speed-up by our parallel implementation in solving the centroidal Voronoi tessellation (CVT) problem as well as some typical computing problems.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with numerical problems arising when performing maximum
		likelihood parameter estimation in speckled imagery using small samples.
		The noise that appears in images obtained with coherent illumination,
		as is the case of sonar, laser, ultrasound-B, and synthetic aperture
		radar, is called speckle, and it can neither be assumed Gaussian
		nor additive. The properties of speckle noise are well described
		by the multiplicative model, a statistical framework from which stem
		several important distributions. Amongst these distributions, one
		is regarded as the universal model for speckled data, namely, the
		G0 law. This paper deals with amplitude data, so the GA0 distribution
		will be used. The literature reports that techniques for obtaining
		estimates (maximum likelihood, based on moments and on order statistics)
		of the parameters of the GA0 distribution require samples of hundreds,
		even thousands, of observations in order to obtain sensible values.
		This is verified for maximum likelihood estimation, and a proposal
		based on alternate optimization is made to alleviate this situation.
		The proposal is assessed with real and simulated data, showing that
		the convergence problems are no longer present. A Monte Carlo experiment
		is devised to estimate the quality of maximum likelihood estimators
		in small samples, and real data is successfully analyzed with the
		proposed alternated procedure. Stylized empirical influence functions
		are computed and used to choose a strategy for computing maximum
		likelihood estimates that is resistant to outliers.},

In order to detect the boundary of a region, initial B-Spline curves are specified, either automatically or manually, and the proposed algorithm uses a deformable contours technique to find the boundary. In doing this, the parameters of the polarimetric GHP model for the data are estimated, in order to find the transition points between the region being segmented and the surrounding area. This is a local algorithm since it works only on the region to be segmented. Results of its performance are presented.},
